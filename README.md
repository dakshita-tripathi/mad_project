##Problem Statement
Rental/Buying System: In college, you often lack the things you need. But there is a high chance that someone else has that thing you need but he has no use for it currently.So make an app where people can list the things they want to rent out or sell. And other users can see their listing and contact them to buy or rent it. 

##Basic idea:
Through our app, one can sell/rent the things they don't need anymore and other college students can view these products and can contact the seller through our app.

##Functionality:
1) new users can registers
2) pre-exisiting users can sign in
3) pre-logged in users directly enter the home screen
4) any user can enlist the items  they want to sell/rent
5) search for any specific category of items
6) view details of any item in that category
7) Contact the seller via mail automatically generated by the app
8) Contact the seller yourself through their phone number
